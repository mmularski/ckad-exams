# CKAD Task Repository - Product Requirements Document

## Overview
The CKAD Task Repository is a collection of authentic CKAD exam tasks organized in a local folder structure. Each exam contains 15-20 hands-on tasks covering all CKAD curriculum domains, with complete environment preparation scripts, task descriptions, and detailed answer keys.

The product solves the problem of lack of realistic hands-on practice tasks for CKAD preparation. Candidates can locally run tasks on their minikube cluster, work under authentic exam conditions, and verify their solutions against professional answers.

The product's value lies in delivering ready-to-use, high-quality CKAD tasks that can be immediately executed locally without needing to build any additional infrastructure or platforms.

## Core Features

### Task Structure Organization
- **Multiple Exam Simulations**: Exam folders (exam-0/, exam-1/, etc.) each containing 15-20 tasks
- **Three-Part Task Structure**: prep/ (preparation), task/ (task content), answer/ (solution)
- **Complete Domain Coverage**: Tasks proportionally distributed according to official CKAD curriculum
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Tasks based on real production use cases
- **Difficulty Gradation**: Mix of simple, medium, and complex tasks with appropriate point values

### Environment Preparation (prep/)
- **Namespace Setup**: namespace.yaml for each task with isolated namespace
- **YAML Resources**: Ready manifests for ConfigMaps, Secrets, base Deployments
- **Multi-Context Configuration**: Preparation of different cluster contexts for tasks requiring context switching
- **Broken Resources**: Intentionally broken configurations for troubleshooting tasks
- **Custom Images**: Instructions and Dockerfiles for tasks requiring custom images
- **Gitignore Files**: .gitignore files to prevent committing student solutions while allowing provided resources

### Task Content (task/)
- **Detailed Descriptions**: task-description.md with clear instructions and success criteria
- **Working Files**: YAMLs to modify, broken configurations to fix
- **Realistic Context**: Tasks embedded in real business application contexts
- **Multi-Step Scenarios**: Complex tasks requiring multiple steps and resource interactions
- **Time Guidelines**: Suggested execution time for each task

### Solutions (answer/)
- **Complete Solutions**: Complete YAMLs with solutions (solution.yaml)
- **Step-by-Step Explanations**: Detailed solution.md with solution steps
- **Alternative Approaches**: Different ways to solve the same problem
- **Validation Scripts**: validation.sh scripts for automated solution verification

## User Experience

### Primary User Personas
**CKAD Candidate**: Developer preparing for the exam, needing realistic practice under exam conditions

**Kubernetes Trainer**: Instructor using tasks for student assessment and practical exercises

**Study Group**: Developer communities organizing collaborative CKAD preparation sessions

### Core User Journey
1. **Repository Setup**: Clone repository, ensure minikube is running
2. **Exam Selection**: Navigate to exam folder (exam-0/, exam-1/, etc.)
3. **Task Preparation**: Apply prep/namespace.yaml to configure environment for specific task
4. **Task Execution**: Read task/task-description.md and implement solution
5. **Solution Verification**: Compare work with answer/ folder contents
6. **Learning Review**: Study explanations and alternative approaches
7. **Environment Reset**: Clean up and prepare for next task

### Workflow Considerations
- **Terminal-First Experience**: All work done via kubectl and text editors (vim/nano)
- **Namespace Isolation**: Each task works in isolated namespaces to prevent conflicts
- **Context Switching**: Tasks require switching between different cluster contexts
- **Documentation Access**: Tasks assume access only to kubernetes.io documentation
- **Time Pressure Simulation**: Tasks designed to be completed within exam time constraints

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Challenges
**Risk**: Tasks requiring specific Kubernetes versions or features
**Mitigation**: Version compatibility documentation, alternative implementations for different K8s versions

**Risk**: Complex multi-cluster scenarios difficult to simulate locally
**Mitigation**: Use namespace-based separation and context switching to simulate multi-cluster environments

**Risk**: Custom image requirements causing setup complexity
**Mitigation**: Provide pre-built images in public registries, include Dockerfile instructions for local building

### Content Quality Risks
**Risk**: Tasks not reflecting actual exam difficulty or format
**Mitigation**: Regular validation against official CKAD curriculum, feedback from certified professionals

**Risk**: Outdated scenarios due to Kubernetes evolution
**Mitigation**: Quarterly review cycle, version tags for different Kubernetes releases

**Risk**: Inconsistent task quality across different domains
**Mitigation**: Standardized task creation templates, peer review process

### Resource Constraints
**Risk**: Limited bandwidth for creating comprehensive task library
**Mitigation**: Focus on quality over quantity, iterative expansion of task library

**Risk**: Maintenance burden for environment scripts
**Mitigation**: Automated testing of prep scripts, clear documentation for troubleshooting

## Appendix
