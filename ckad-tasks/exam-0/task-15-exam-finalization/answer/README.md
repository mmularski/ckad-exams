# exam-0 Project

This project contains a set of Kubernetes tasks designed to help you prepare for the CKAD exam. Each task includes:

- A clear scenario and requirements
- Prep manifests to set up the environment
- A solution and validation script

## Structure

- `prep/`: Setup manifests and scripts
- `task/`: Task descriptions
- `answer/`: Solutions and documentation

## How to Use

1. Review the task description in each `task/` directory.
2. Apply the manifests in `prep/` to set up the environment.
3. Attempt the task, then compare your solution with the one in `answer/`.
4. Use the validation script to check your work.

Good luck!
